                        <p>The Chatbot is an automated computer response system, which conducts a conversation via
                            auditory or textual methods. It provides information to the customer in automated fashion. A
                            predefined questionnaire with prepared answer is loaded in the process. Chatbot are
                            typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service
                            or information acquisition. Chatbot applications streamline interactions between people and
                            services, enhancing customer experience. At the same time, they offer companies new
                            opportunities to improve the customerâ€™s engagement process and operational efficiency by
                            reducing the typical cost of customer service.</p>
                        <p>A pre-defined and configurable questioner along with answers in Blue Prism are used to
                            provide the service information. The bot wait for customer response first. Then it ask for
                            User Name and email id which will help the bot to send the content details the user seek, in
                            email. Based on organizational need the questioner need to be updated so that the user is
                            provided with ample information, on his request.</p>
