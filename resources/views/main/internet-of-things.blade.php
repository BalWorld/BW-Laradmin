        <h1 class="f-600">What is Internet of Things?</h1>
        <p class="pb-2">The Internet of Things is the extension of internet connectivity into physical devices and
            everyday objects. Embedded with electronics, internet connectivity and other forms of hardware, these
            devices can communicate and interact with others over the internet and they can be remotely monitored and
            controlled. The 'thing' in IoT could be a person with a heart monitor or an automobile with
            built-in-sensors. The embedded technology in objects helps them to interact with internal states or the
            external environment which in turn affects the decisions taken.</p>

                        <p>If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things- using data they
                            gathered without any help from us â€“ we would be able to track and count everything and
                            greatly reduce waste, loss and cost. We would knew when things needed replacing, repairing
                            and whether they were fresh or past their best. We need to empower computers with their own
                            means of gathering information, so they can see, hear and smell the world for themselves.
                            This is precisely what IoT platform does for us. It enables devices/objects to observe,
                            identify and understand a situation without being dependent on human help. </p>

                        <h1>What is scope of IoT?</h1>
                        <p>Internet of Things can connect devices embedded in various systems to the internet. When
                            devices can represent themselves digitally, they can be controlled from anywhere. The
                            connectivity then helps us capture more data from more places, ensuring more ways of
                            increasing efficiency and improving safety and IoT security. IoT is transformational force
                            that can help companies improve performance through IoT analytics and IoT Security to
                            deliver better results. Business in the utilities, oil &amp; gas , insurance, manufacturing,
                            transportation and retail sectors can reap the benefits of IoT making more informed
                            decisions , aided by the torrent of interactional and transactional data at their disposal.

                        <p> IoT platforms can help organizations reduce cost through improved process efficiency, asset
                            utilization and productivity. With improved tracking of devices using sensors and
                            connectivity, they can benefit from real-time insights and analytics, which would help them
                            make smarter decisions. The growth and convergence of data, processes and things on the
                            internet would make such connections more relevant and important , creating more
                            opportunities for people, business and industries. </p>
