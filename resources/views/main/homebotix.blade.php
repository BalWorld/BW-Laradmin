                <p class="pb-2">Home automation can quickly bring the future in to our homes by incorporating security,
                    climate, and household gadgets and transforms our regular home into a futuristic smart home. These
                    smart home systems can be used for simple or elaborate tasks by integrating devices and gadgets
                    inside and outside of your home.<br>
                    A simple definition for home automation is the ability to do tasks automatically and monitor or
                    change status remotely. Common tasks include turning off lights when no one is in the room, locking
                    doors via smartphone, automates air condition systems that can sense and memorize temperature
                    settings and appliances that help you reduce the time you spend in the kitchen.</p>

                <h1 class="f-600">Overview</h1>
                <p class="pb-2">A home automation system consists of a device which communicates to a gateway or a hub.
                    The number of devices required in your home depends on the degree of control you wish to have in
                    your home .This can be achieved by using DIY set up or full automation system.
                    <br>Each device works with a protocol. Your choice of protocol will determine which products you can
                    use in your system. Some of the most common protocols include :
                </p>
                <p class="pb-2">Bluetooth — This is common for using a few devices from a computer or mobile device, and
                    built into most smartphones.
                    Wi-Fi — Major number of home automation devices works on your wireless internet connection, connects
                    into your wireless router.
                    Apart from Wi-Fi, Bluetooth protocols there are zig-bee and z-wave are available in the market. Both
                    are wireless protocols which use mesh network to communicate. Each of these protocols should have a
                    set of products that work with its technology.</p>
