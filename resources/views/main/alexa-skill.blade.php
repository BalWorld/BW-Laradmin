        <p class="pb-2">Alexa for Business from Amazon Web Services allows companies to use Alexa on the job, to provide
            Alexa device management, to register users, and to assign competences on the scale. Use the Alexa Skills Kit
            and Alexa for business apis to develop intelligent and customized abilities and make them accessible to
            companies as personal abilities.
            <br>
            Organizations can provide shared Alexa phones for everyone to use in common fields around the workplace as
            well as private Alexa devices for staff to use with Alexa for Business. Alexa can simplify meeting rooms and
            assist around the office with shared tools, and anyone can access them. Alexaâ€™s personal phones allow
            consumers to be more productive all day long, at job or at home.
